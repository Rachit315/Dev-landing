## Introduction

This feature adds a theme toggle switch to the existing navbar that allows users to switch between light and dark themes. The toggle will be visually consistent with the website's design language, accessible across all device sizes, and provide a smooth user experience with theme persistence.

4. WHEN the theme changes THEN the system SHALL animate the transition smoothly without jarring visual changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme system to integrate seamlessly with the existing next-themes setup, so that the implementation is maintainable and follows best practices.
