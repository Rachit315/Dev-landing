# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the Vercel deployment failure caused by platform-specific dependencies in the React client application. The deployment is currently failing because the build process attempts to install Windows-specific packages (`@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc`) on Vercel's Linux environment. The solution involves removing platform-specific dependencies, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, and updating the build configuration to work seamlessly with pnpm on Vercel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my application to deploy successfully on Vercel, so that I can share my project with users and stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment process runs on Vercel THEN the system SHALL complete the build without platform-specific dependency errors
2. WHEN pnpm install is executed THEN the system SHALL install all dependencies without OS-specific package conflicts
3. WHEN the build command runs THEN the system SHALL generate production-ready assets successfully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use pnpm as the package manager consistently, so that I can maintain dependency consistency and faster installation times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built locally THEN the system SHALL use pnpm for dependency management
2. WHEN the project is deployed on Vercel THEN the system SHALL use pnpm for dependency installation
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL respect pnpm lockfile for version consistency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cross-platform compatibility for my build process, so that the application can be built on any operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build runs on Windows THEN the system SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN the build runs on Linux THEN the system SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN the build runs on macOS THEN the system SHALL complete successfully
4. IF platform-specific dependencies are needed THEN the system SHALL use optional dependencies or platform-agnostic alternatives

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Vercel deployment to automatically use the correct build configuration, so that I don't need to manually configure deployment settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN Vercel SHALL automatically trigger a deployment
2. WHEN the deployment starts THEN the system SHALL use the correct build command and output directory
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL serve the static files from the correct directory
