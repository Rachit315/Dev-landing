# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Remove platform-specific dependencies from client package.json



  - Remove `@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc` from devDependencies in Client/react-pixel-perfect-showcase/package.json
  - Verify no other platform-specific packages exist in dependencies


  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 2. Update root package.json build scripts to use pnpm consistently
  - Modify build script to use `pnpm install` instead of `npm install`


  - Update all package manager references from npm to pnpm
  - Ensure build command points to correct client directory
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_



- [ ] 3. Create Vercel configuration for proper deployment
  - Create or update vercel.json in project root with correct build settings
  - Specify build command, output directory, and install command
  - Configure rewrites for SPA routing if needed


  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Regenerate pnpm lockfile to ensure consistency
  - Delete existing pnpm-lock.yaml in client directory


  - Run pnpm install to generate new lockfile without platform-specific dependencies
  - Verify lockfile contains only cross-platform compatible packages
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_




- [ ] 5. Update .vercelignore to exclude unnecessary files
  - Add node_modules, .git, and other build artifacts to .vercelignore
  - Ensure only necessary files are included in deployment
  - Optimize deployment size and speed
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Test local build process with pnpm
  - Run pnpm install in client directory to verify dependency installation
  - Execute pnpm run build to ensure build completes successfully
  - Verify generated dist folder contains all necessary assets
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_

- [ ] 7. Validate cross-platform compatibility
  - Test build process works without platform-specific dependencies
  - Ensure Vite configuration is compatible with Linux environment
  - Verify no Windows-specific paths or configurations remain
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
